Problem Statement 
Modern life often complicates efforts to maintain a healthy lifestyle, with busy schedules 
making it difficult to track and balance physical activity, diet, and mental health. For example, a 
busy professional may find it challenging to keep track of their daily exercise, maintain a balanced 
diet, and manage stress. Without a comprehensive tool to monitor these aspects, individuals may 
struggle to identify patterns and make informed decisions about their health. Existing health apps 
often focus on isolated aspects like diet tracking or workout logging, leaving users without a holistic 
view of their overall well-being.
